# Project Goals
With only four members on our team, the AcceptED team has given us a very large project. As of now we are still unsure of when the project will be completed. The team is now getting into the groove of working with one another. Walker has almost finished the database, Andrew has been working with both Walker, Muhammad, and Taichen in areas needed, Taichen is working primarily in the frontend currently then will switch to help add the funcitonality for the backend, and Muhammad is assisting both Taichen and basic project management.

We have been contracted by AcceptED's team to create a Student dashboard, Education Consultant Dashboard, and an Admin's dashboard. We were only given a Student and Education Consultant dashboard frontend, so we need to consult with the design team on what to do.

It has been noted though, that the Design team's contract is over. So we will try to get one last meeting with them before they completely aren't open to help.

# Repository Revamp

Starting out, our repository was a mess. It was decided that we should follow basic software development methodology. The following is stated:

1. We have main (production branch)
2. We create a dev branch which is a branch off of main
3. When you take a ticket (from trello). You should create a branch from dev with the a short name. “Home-Frontend” or “MyTasks”. This will be denoted as the feature branch.
4. When you are ready for a code review, you make a pull request to dev from your branch, and you ping the other developers (and also add the ticket into code review in trello).
5. From step 4, if the code review goes good, you accept the pull request. Then after we get a good amount of progress on dev (at every interval or so) and development branch is stable, we can make a pull request to main. (Note: Nothing should be pushed to main for now since we don’t even have a prototype to show)

The reason we switched to this, is because people were stepping on other people's toes during coding. It was hard to figure out who was making changes, and where to backtrack. With this stable method we should be able to get proper work moving forward.
