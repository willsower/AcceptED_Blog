# Design Team

As stated before, the design team's contract had been finished. Muhammand and Taichen were able to contact June who was the lead for the Design Team. She noted that she could meet us once to answer any lingering questions we had.

Muhammad wasn't able to make the meeting but Taichen was able to. Here are the questions that were asked and the corresponding answers:

Questions for Design Team:

Notes:

-   When EC's create tasks not sure how it looks (can EC's create modules? Is this predetermined?)

Muhammad Questions/Comments:

-   Do we need to design/develop the admin portal?

Taichen Questions/Comments:

Logo: Many of us have noticed that your logo is phallic shaped :]

General Questions

-   For clicking on buttons/hovering, do you guys have any specific hovering thing? I can use basic UX and intuition if you don't have anything specific Nothing specific

-   Can we get rid of university code at the signup page? Go over with AcceptED (the university code is more about program for the EC rather than what college they want to go to)

-   Were you guys able to get in user testing done by change? Do user testing if possible

Google Authentication

-   We are thinking of integrating with google. This may change the sign up page a little, did you guys think about integrating with google? If so, what did the design team come up with pros/conso? Yes (talk to accepted)

Home Page Questions (EC)

-   Modules are dynamic right? Initially there will be NO modules. EC uploads module 1, then there will only be Module 1 in the tab, etc (Talk to AcceptED)

-   How are modules going to be assigned to different students? Or will all the students the EC have - have the same module 1, module 2, etc? (Talk to accepted) -> Modules are created by curriculum eam (but this module we will go over something (soft skills, public speaking)) -> EC's and students will figure out their own curriculum in a sense. Have EC's be given different levels of admin (some EC's can edit things, some can't)

-   Recent Essays

-   The image that is brought up , is this expected to be the document preview (like in google drive)? Yes

-   In My Tasks

-   With empty my tasks, what happens if you press "add a task", that shouldn't lead you to tasks page since that is different?

-   So these tasks are for only today? (Says Today at top)

-   What happens if tasks are checked? Do we keep them there? Or delete them? (If we don't build it out AcceptED may not care, focus on other things first, come to this after. )

Materials

-   With google authentication we were possibly thinking of also integrating this with google drive. It looks like (if we don't integrate with google drive) we have to make our own file system.

-   Are folders static? As in the EC can't add more folders? (Add/edit folders -> ask AcceptED) => Add plus next to fodler

-   For clarification on materials/Curriculum. The Files + (add files) are files that are added just for notes/reference, while the Add Curiulum + is a TODO item?

-   In Materials -> Resource

-   What's the difference between file upload and add resource upload? What's the difference between "add file", "add resource", and "add curriculum"

-   Then of these, what gets displayed on the user's recent essays on home page? Would that be recent curriculum, resource?

-   Curriculum: If EC has a resume template, they could upload to their students. (Show to all students)  -> May be exclusive to ONLY the curriculum team (the average EC might not get to add the curriculum)

-   Resources: Mostly for the user (templates, things to look at)

-   EDIT: Average EC may only be able to add files/folders

-   Admin(more privileged EC can add curri/resources)

Tasks

-   Do we need module 1 ...12 on here?

-   I'm only asking because with Essays for a University, how would that work in a module? 

-   In Tasks, when you open modal, do you need to add a "Comment" section? I feel like Slack (or whatever messaging service) should be used to communicate/comment on things? (Not essential for now, can come back around after)

Profile Page Questions (EC) -> https://retool.com/

-   How will the EC delete students? Or do they not have that power? (Possibly have admin delete, ask accepted)

-   When a user wants to change their profile picture, should we have that in the edit profile modal, or just when the user clicks on their current picture they can change? (For now put it modal)

-   I made some adjustments on things I don't think the user should be able to change. (For example Join Date)

Speaking with the design team, it was noted that we won't be able to contact them afterwords since they are graduating. We also learned that we have to build an admin portal, but we will also need to design it ourselves since the Design team was contracted to only build the first two.

From this meeting, it was noted that we would have to meet with AcceptED's leadership team to fill the gaps, since a lot of the questions and answers seemed unsure. We also decided to integrate with Google from meeting with the design team.
