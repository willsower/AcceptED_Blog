## The Organization

**AcceptED** is based from the University of Southern California (USC), they are an undergraduate student organization focused on providing free college application assistance to prospective first-year and transfer students throughout greater Los Angeles. Through partnerships with local high schools and community colleges, such as Los Angeles Trade Technical College (LATTC), they collaborate with school administration to implement their year-long mentorship program. Below is an overview of the programâ€™s objectives:

- Career identification and determining academic major interest
- Understanding college admission process
- Develop financial aid literacy and pursuing appropriate scholarships
- Provide standardized test preparation materials
- Craft a unique applicant profile

## The Project

The project that AcceptED has proposed is to create a website to help optimize the college admissions process experience for high schoolers and their personal college coaches. This project has three seperate teams, the AcceptED team which are the main overseers of the project, the Design team, charged with creating the general front-end layout and perform user testing, and the engineering team which will be tasked with creating the project. All teams communicate with one another via Slack and sometimes host meetings through zoom.

The end users for this project will be the students, an education consultant (EC), and an administrator. Students will be able to speak with their assigned education consultants for guidance. EC's will be able to create a schedule for their assigned students, look over their essays, and giving them small assignments to complete. All users will be contacting each other via Rocketchat which will be embedded into the system.

## Current Progress

**Design Team**

The design team is currently in their last iteration for their final design. They had low-fi mockups, mid mocks and will have their final mockups due around April 15th. You can currently look at the different mockups [here](https://www.figma.com/file/101K9KnxQawaQxuWqftrPN/ACCEPTED-WEBSITE-REDESIGN?node-id=0%3A1). When you get to this link, you can go to the top left corner of the figma page (to the left of the blue hand icon in the nav) and toggle between the low, mid, and high fidality mockups.

**Engineering Team**

The engineering team which is currently comprised of (5 members - 1 frontend developer, 4 backend developers) is still communicating on tools and technologies to use. And meets up with both the design and accepted teams to get clarification on seperate components.

We have a shared google folder where we list our notes in regards to the tools and technologies we are currently looking at. 

## Our Roles

**Walker Herring** will be working on the backend in creating the application.

**Taichen Rose** will be working on both the frontend and backend of the application. She will mainly be focussing on the frontend.
