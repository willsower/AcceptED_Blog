## Frontend

**React.JS**

React.JS was one of the frameworks that our team thought of initially. React being one of the most powerful frontend frameworks with being able to work with a backend and database, this was a logical choice. However, React is also one of the hardest frameworks to learn, so we are keeping our options open, and looking at other subsets of React such as Next.JS which is explained below.

**Next.JS**

Next.JS came to our attention after two meetings with a company in Germany creating an application called Deta. Meeting up with them, they showed their technologies and the benefits of using Next vs React. Doing further research Next.JS has been used in various websites such as Netflix, Hulu, and others.

Taichen is currently doing extensive research with Next.JS since she will be leading the charge on the frontend, and this blog has also been created with Next.JS.

## Backend

**Django**
