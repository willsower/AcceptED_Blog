This is a short post/update since both Walker and Taichen are very busy with finals currently.

# Google Integration

Our team has managed to get Google Integration in some aspects. Andrew was able to get the basic Google Auth itnegration and parts of Google Calendar.

Taichen will need to update Andrew's implementation and create a front facing component for this. Walker will assist the team with using Google Integration in our project.
