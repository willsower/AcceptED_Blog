# Frontend

Currently in our Next.JS project we are using function based components. Our full codebase was refactored to class based components. After speaking with Muhammad, switching to class based components helps us (the developers) in using states. At the end of the day, class based and function based components accomplish the same things.

# Backend

Walker has finalized the database from our current knowledge and is starting to help add to the basic functionality in the backend. For example, when users want to add tasks, the information will start to update in the database.

After getting the database finalized, our team has been able to start creating mock data, and populating that information in the profile section dynamicaly instead of staticly. From meeting with the design team, we also shared the idea of integrating with google since the Design team approves our idea. Research has started to be done ot integrate Google Auth for creating safe sign ins, Google Calendar, and Google Drive APIs.
